# 📘 Assignment: Data Structures in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Master Python's core data structures including lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples to efficiently store, manipulate, and access data in your programs.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Lists and Tuples

#### Description
Learn to work with lists and tuples for ordered collections of data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create and manipulate lists (append, insert, remove, sort)
- Use list comprehensions for efficient data processing
- Work with tuples for immutable sequences
- Perform slicing and indexing operations
- Demonstrate list methods and tuple unpacking

### 🛠️ Dictionaries

#### Description
Implement dictionaries for key-value pair storage and fast lookups.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create dictionaries with various key types
- Add, update, and delete dictionary entries
- Use dictionary methods (keys, values, items, get)
- Implement nested dictionaries
- Handle dictionary comprehensions

### 🛠️ Sets

#### Description
Utilize sets for unique collections and mathematical set operations.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create sets and add/remove elements
- Perform set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Use set methods and frozen sets
- Demonstrate set comprehensions
- Handle set membership testing

### 🛠️ Data Structure Integration

#### Description
Combine different data structures to solve complex problems.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a program that uses all four data structures
- Implement data conversion between types
- Build a simple database-like structure using nested dicts/lists
- Perform complex data manipulations and queries
- Demonstrate practical use cases for each structure
