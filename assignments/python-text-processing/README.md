# 📘 Assignment: Python Text Processing

## 🎯 Objective

Learn Python text processing techniques including string manipulation, file input/output operations, and text analysis to build practical text-handling applications.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ String Manipulation Basics

#### Description
Practice fundamental string operations in Python to manipulate and transform text data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Demonstrate string concatenation, slicing, and indexing
- Use string methods like split(), join(), replace(), and strip()
- Handle case conversion (upper, lower, title)
- Perform basic string formatting and f-strings

### 🛠️ File Input/Output Operations

#### Description
Implement file reading and writing operations to process text files in Python.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read text from a file using different methods (read(), readline(), readlines())
- Write text to a file with proper encoding
- Handle file exceptions and use context managers (with statement)
- Append to existing files and create new files

### 🛠️ Text Processing Application

#### Description
Build a comprehensive text processing application that combines string manipulation and file I/O.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read a text file and perform word count analysis
- Find and replace text patterns in the file
- Extract specific information (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers)
- Generate a summary report with statistics (word count, unique words, etc.)
- Save processed results to a new file
